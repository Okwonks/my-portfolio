## Project Name: My Portfolio

This is a project made as part of my course work at [Moringa School](http://moringaschool.com/)
It is a project that allows me to test my ability to grasp what I learned and how I apply it.
For a beginner writing this project was *hard!* I took the whole day to complete it.
I am glad to have a portfolio up and have something to build upon.

### Project Setup: No setup is required
